	abstract = {As is the case in several research domains, data sharing is still scarce in the ﬁeld of Brain-Computer Interfaces ({BCI}), and particularly in that of passive {BCIs}—i.e., systems that enable implicit interaction or task adaptation based on a user’s mental state(s) estimated from brain measures. Moreover, research in this ﬁeld is currently hindered by a major challenge, which is tackling brain signal variability such as cross-session variability. Hence, with a view to develop good research practices in this ﬁeld and to enable the whole community to join forces in working on cross-session estimation, we created the ﬁrst passive brain-computer interface competition on cross-session workload estimation. This competition was part of the 3rd International Neuroergonomics conference. The data were electroencephalographic recordings acquired from 15 volunteers (6 females; average 25 y.o.) who performed 3 sessions—separated by 7 days—of the Multi-Attribute Task Battery-{II} ({MATB}-{II}) with 3 levels of difﬁculty per session (pseudo-randomized order). The data -training and testing sets—were made publicly available on Zenodo along with Matlab and Python toy code (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5055046). To this day, the database was downloaded more than 900 times (unique downloads of all version on the 10th of December 2021: 911). Eleven teams from 3 continents (31 participants) submitted their work. The best achieving processing pipelines included a Riemannian geometry-based method. Although better than the adjusted chance level (38\% with an α at 0.05 for a 3-class classiﬁcation problem), the results still remained under 60\% of accuracy. These results clearly underline the real challenge that is cross-session estimation. Moreover, they conﬁrmed once more the robustness and effectiveness of Riemannian methods for {BCI}. On the contrary, chance level results were obtained by one third of the methods—4 teams- based on Deep Learning. These methods have not demonstrated superior results in this contest compared to traditional methods, which may be due to severe overﬁtting. Yet this competition is the ﬁrst step toward a joint effort to tackle {BCI} variability and to promote good research practices including reproducibility.},

	abstract = {Covariance matrices have attracted attention for machine learning applications due
to their capacity to capture interesting structure in the data. The main challenge
is that one needs to take into account the particular geometry of the Riemannian
manifold of symmetric positive definite ({SPD}) matrices they belong to. In the con-
text of deep networks, several architectures for these matrices have recently been
proposed. In our article, we introduce a Riemannian batch normalization (batch-
norm) algorithm, which generalizes the one used in Euclidean nets. This novel
layer makes use of geometric operations on the manifold, notably the Riemannian
barycenter, parallel transport and non-linear structured matrix transformations. We
derive a new manifold-constrained gradient descent algorithm working in the space
of {SPD} matrices, allowing to learn the batchnorm layer. We validate our proposed
approach with experiments in three different contexts on diverse data types: a
drone recognition dataset from radar observations, and on emotion and action
recognition datasets from video and motion capture data. Experiments show that
the Riemannian batchnorm systematically gives better classification performance
compared with leading methods and a remarkable robustness to lack of data.},

	abstract = {Advances in brain science and computer technology in the past decade have led to exciting developments in brain–computer interface ({BCI}), thereby making {BCI} a top research area in applied science. The renaissance of {BCI} opens new methods of neurorehabilitation for physically disabled people (e.g. paralyzed patients and amputees) and patients with brain injuries (e.g. stroke patients). Recent technological advances such as wireless recording, machine learning analysis, and real-time temporal resolution have increased interest in electroencephalographic ({EEG}) based {BCI} approaches. Many {BCI} studies have focused on decoding {EEG} signals associated with whole-body kinematics/kinetics, motor imagery, and various senses. Thus, there is a need to understand the various experimental paradigms used in {EEG}-based {BCI} systems. Moreover, given that there are many available options, it is essential to choose the most appropriate {BCI} application to properly manipulate a neuroprosthetic or neurorehabilitation device. The current review evaluates {EEG}-based {BCI} paradigms regarding their advantages and disadvantages from a variety of perspectives. For each paradigm, various {EEG} decoding algorithms and classification methods are evaluated. The applications of these paradigms with targeted patients are summarized. Finally, potential problems with {EEG}-based {BCI} systems are discussed, and possible solutions are proposed.},

	abstract = {We present a novel approach based on deep learning for decoding sensory information from non-invasively recorded Electroencephalograms ({EEG}). It can either be used in a passive Brain-Computer Interface ({BCI}) to predict properties of a visual stimulus the person is viewing, or it can be used to actively control a {BCI} application. Both scenarios were tested, whereby an average information transfer rate ({ITR}) of 701 bit/min was achieved for the passive {BCI} approach with the best subject achieving an online {ITR} of 1237 bit/min. Further, it allowed the discrimination of 500,000 different visual stimuli based on only 2 seconds of {EEG} data with an accuracy of up to 100\%. When using the method for an asynchronous self-paced {BCI} for spelling, an average utility rate of 175 bit/min was achieved, which corresponds to an average of 35 error-free letters per minute. As the presented method extracts more than three times more information than the previously fastest approach, we suggest that {EEG} signals carry more information than generally assumed. Finally, we observed a ceiling effect such that information content in the {EEG} exceeds that required for {BCI} control, and therefore we discuss if {BCI} research has reached a point where the performance of non-invasive visual {BCI} control cannot be substantially improved anymore.},

# Hyperscanning

This is an example on how one can leverage Timelux's [environment](https://doc.timeflux.io/en/latest/usage/getting_started.html#environment) and the [Jinja templating engine](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/) to quickly design hyperscanning pipelines.

Configure your environment in the [.env](.env) file.

Run the app:

```
$ timeflux main.yaml
```

Please consult the [command line documentation](https://doc.timeflux.io/en/latest/usage/getting_started.html#command-line-options) to set the path of the environment file.
